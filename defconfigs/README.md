# CachyMod default configuration files

Do not edit the files in this directory.
Rather, make a copy to your HOME config folder.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/cachymod
cp *.conf ~/.config/cachymod/
```

Changes can be made with the `confmod.sh` utility.

Building a kernel is with `build.sh confname` command,
as shown in the README.
